# Youtube-Shares-Prediction
Implementing a linear regression model to predict the amount of shares a certain Youtube video has. Also my first ever Git Repository :).

R2 is roughly 0.454. Not the best, but it was the best I could do given the dataset I had. Other variables outside the dataset would need to be measured to increase this value
